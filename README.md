# Apple Quality Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering in Python, use of Random Forests and k-means

The Apple Quality Assessment project utilizes a predictive model to enhance apple sorting processes by assessing their quality based on multiple physical and chemical characteristics. This innovation not only streamlines agribusiness operations but also boosts consumer satisfaction and strengthens brand reputation.

**Data Description**

Data was sourced from quality control data from kaggle, covering thousands of apple samples with attributes like color, weight, acidity, and sugar content. Extensive preprocessing techniques such as missing value imputation, categorical variable encoding, and normalization were applied to prepare the data for analysis.

**Analysis and Insights**

Descriptive analytics confirmed a well-distributed dataset across various apple quality categories, with key features including sugar content and acidity playing pivotal roles in quality prediction.

**Visualization**

Visual tools, including confusion matrices and PCA scatter plots, illustrated the data's complexity and feature interrelations.

 
**Model Descriptions**

The project leveraged Random Forest and K-Means clustering algorithms. Random Forest was chosen for its robustness in handling complex, non-linear data sets, while K-Means helped explore underlying data groupings, enhancing the understanding of apple quality divisions.

**Results**

The models demonstrated high accuracy, with Random Forest achieving significant precision and recall in quality prediction. These outcomes highlight the models' effectiveness in classifying apple quality efficiently.
